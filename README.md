    Introduction to RISC-V basic Keywords
  </Summary>


  RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, it is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses.RISC-V is a completely open architecture, allowing anyone to create processors based on the design or create improvements without complicated licensing agreements. RISC-V is a popular alternative to proprietary architectures available today, such as those by ARM. The concept behind RISC-V was motivated by the truth that most of the processor instructions were not utilized by most computer programs, so unnecessary decoding logic was being utilized within the designs of processors, consuming more power and area. The RISC-V processor was implemented to shorten the instruction set and invest more within register resources.

  # *From Apps to Hardware*

  The Applications that we generally use enters into the system software and then system software converts High Level Language into Assembly language and subsequently into binary form.
  
 System software has three components:
 1. Operating system
 2. Compiler
 3. Assembler

System software performs the following tasks:
1. It handles the I/O operations
2. It allocates the memory
3. It is low level system function
4. It takes the high level language and converts into binary.

  Following figure correctly depicts the flow diagram of system software.

The Screenshot given below depicts the Memory Allocation and stack pointer. it is used for transfering datas from Registers to the memory, or any data transfer happening between memory, stack pointer and the registers:

The command used:

```
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out

```
