    Introduction to RISC-V basic Keywords
  </Summary>


  RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, it is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses.RISC-V is a completely open architecture, allowing anyone to create processors based on the design or create improvements without complicated licensing agreements. RISC-V is a popular alternative to proprietary architectures available today, such as those by ARM. The concept behind RISC-V was motivated by the truth that most of the processor instructions were not utilized by most computer programs, so unnecessary decoding logic was being utilized within the designs of processors, consuming more power and area. The RISC-V processor was implemented to shorten the instruction set and invest more within register resources.

     From Apps to Hardware

  The Applications that we generally use enters into the system software and then system software converts High Level Language into Assembly language and subsequently into binary form.
  
 System software has three components:
 1. Operating system
 2. Compiler
 3. Assembler

System software performs the following tasks:
1. It handles the I/O operations
2. It allocates the memory
3. It is low level system function
4. It takes the high level language and converts into binary.

  Following figure correctly depicts the flow diagram of system software.

 Sequential logic with TL-verilog using makerchip
</summary>

**What is TL verilog?**

TL-Verilog is a Verilog implementation of TL-X, a language extension that extends any HDL with transaction-level modeling. It is specifically designed for modeling hardware and provides abstract context suited to hardware design with numerous benefits. TL-Verilog eliminates the need for legacy language features of Verilog and introduces simpler syntax. It adds powerful constructs for pipelines and transactions, making it more powerful and has a significant code reduction as compared to other HDL languages.TL-Verilog is built for the design process, not for the mere description of static designs. TL-VHDL is a project that aims to layer transaction-level support on other languages to broaden the reach of the technology.

    Pipelining
  </summary>

  Pipelining is a design technique used to improve the throughput of a digital system by breaking down the processing of a task into multiple stages, with each stage performing a specific operation on the data. In traditional Verilog, describing pipelined designs can be quite verbose and require manual management of pipeline registers. TL Verilog simplifies this process by introducing constructs that allow you to define pipelines more easily.

In TL Verilog, the pipelining feature allows you to specify the pipeline stages, their functionality, and the data flow between them using high-level constructs. This abstraction can help designers focus on the functional aspects of the pipeline rather than getting bogged down in the low-level implementation details.

  **Illustration 10 - Conway game of life**

  Here in each cycle, the liveness of a cell (square in the grid) is based on its eight neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally). An empty cell comes to life if it had exactly three live neighbors. It dies if it has fewer than two live neighbors (starvation) or more than three (overpopulation).

This example implements Conwayâ€™s Life. The grid is constructed using behavioral hierarchy.
