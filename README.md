    Introduction to RISC-V basic Keywords
  </Summary>


  RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, it is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses.RISC-V is a completely open architecture, allowing anyone to create processors based on the design or create improvements without complicated licensing agreements. RISC-V is a popular alternative to proprietary architectures available today, such as those by ARM. The concept behind RISC-V was motivated by the truth that most of the processor instructions were not utilized by most computer programs, so unnecessary decoding logic was being utilized within the designs of processors, consuming more power and area. The RISC-V processor was implemented to shorten the instruction set and invest more within register resources.

     From Apps to Hardware

  The Applications that we generally use enters into the system software and then system software converts High Level Language into Assembly language and subsequently into binary form.
  
 System software has three components:
 1. Operating system
 2. Compiler
 3. Assembler

System software performs the following tasks:
1. It handles the I/O operations
2. It allocates the memory
3. It is low level system function
4. It takes the high level language and converts into binary.

  Following figure correctly depicts the flow diagram of system software.

 Sequential logic with TL-verilog using makerchip

**What is TL verilog?**

TL-Verilog is a Verilog implementation of TL-X, a language extension that extends any HDL with transaction-level modeling. It is specifically designed for modeling hardware and provides abstract context suited to hardware design with numerous benefits. TL-Verilog eliminates the need for legacy language features of Verilog and introduces simpler syntax. It adds powerful constructs for pipelines and transactions, making it more powerful and has a significant code reduction as compared to other HDL languages.TL-Verilog is built for the design process, not for the mere description of static designs. TL-VHDL is a project that aims to layer transaction-level support on other languages to broaden the reach of the technology.

    Pipelining
  </summary>

  Pipelining is a design technique used to improve the throughput of a digital system by breaking down the processing of a task into multiple stages, with each stage performing a specific operation on the data. In traditional Verilog, describing pipelined designs can be quite verbose and require manual management of pipeline registers. TL Verilog simplifies this process by introducing constructs that allow you to define pipelines more easily.

In TL Verilog, the pipelining feature allows you to specify the pipeline stages, their functionality, and the data flow between them using high-level constructs. This abstraction can help designers focus on the functional aspects of the pipeline rather than getting bogged down in the low-level implementation details.

  **Illustration 10 - Conway game of life**

  Here in each cycle, the liveness of a cell (square in the grid) is based on its eight neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally). An empty cell comes to life if it had exactly three live neighbors. It dies if it has fewer than two live neighbors (starvation) or more than three (overpopulation).

This example implements Conwayâ€™s Life. The grid is constructed using behavioral hierarchy.

# Day 4 : Basic RISC-V micro architecture

    Introduction to simple RISC-V micro architecture

  ![Screenshot from 2023-08-22 22-08-23](https://github.com/Vartika-iiitb/Vartika_RISC-V/assets/140998716/8fd17574-6c64-4b79-9946-5fa3c3114406)


After building up strong basics built in TL-Verilog and digital design, and getting completely familiar with the Makerchip Platform, it was time to move on to the core aspect of the workshop, i.e. to build a RISC V core. On this day , the following basic blocks were implemented :

**1. Program Counter (PC)**

A program counter, also known as the instruction pointer, instruction address register, or sequence control register, is a register in a computer processor that contains the address of the next instruction to be executed from memory.As each instruction is fetched, the program counter increases its stored value by 1. After each instruction is fetched, the program counter points to the next instruction in the sequence. The address specified by the PC will be + n (+1 for a 1-word instruction and +2 for a 2-word instruction) each time one instruction is executed. In the case of an interrupt instruction, the jump destination address is stored.0 The program counter is a fundamental component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU).

**2. Imem-Rd ( Instruction Memory)**

The "instruction memory" refers to a component or subsystem that stores and provides instructions to the processor. It is an essential part of the overall processor architecture, especially in the context of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA).
he instruction memory's main function is to hold the machine code instructions that the processor fetches, decodes, and executes to perform various tasks and operations.

**3. Instruction Decoder**

The "instruction decoder" is a crucial component responsible for interpreting the fetched machine code instructions and determining the appropriate actions that the processor needs to take in order to execute the instruction. It plays a central role in the instruction execution process and is typically located after the instruction fetch stage and before the execution units in the processor pipeline.

**4. Register File**

The register file is a storage component that holds the processor's general-purpose registers. These registers are used for temporary storage of data during instruction execution. In RISC-V, the register file contains a fixed number of registers (e.g., 32 registers in a standard RISC-V implementation).

**5. Arithmatic Logic Unit (ALU)**

In the RISC-V architecture, the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations on binary data. It is a critical component within the processor that executes instructions by manipulating data according to the instruction's operation code (opcode) and operands.


Thus the instruction set architecture of base integer instructions, next_pc logic, the register file, ALU, branch instructions, etc. and eventually the CPU core was built and tested, using appropriate testbench logic, and assembly code developed on Day 2, by the end of the day.
