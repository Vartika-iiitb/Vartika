    Introduction to RISC-V basic Keywords
  </Summary>
  RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, it is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses.RISC-V is a completely open architecture, allowing anyone to create processors based on the design or create improvements without complicated licensing agreements. RISC-V is a popular alternative to proprietary architectures available today, such as those by ARM. The concept behind RISC-V was motivated by the truth that most of the processor instructions were not utilized by most computer programs, so unnecessary decoding logic was being utilized within the designs of processors, consuming more power and area. The RISC-V processor was implemented to shorten the instruction set and invest more within register resources.
